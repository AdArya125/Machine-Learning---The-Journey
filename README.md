# Machine-Learning---The-Journey
This repository is my personal collection of topics and codes, that I learnt and will learn in the future in relation to the domain of data science and Machine Learning, This repository should be like a short reference guide to a lot of topics.

The tentative list of topics I plan to cover here is as follows:

1. **Statistics for Machine Learning**
2. **Data Preprocessing and Feature Engineering**
3. **Optimization**
4. **Supervised Learning**
5. **Model Evaluation and Validation**
6. **Unsupervised Learning**
7. **Neural Networks and Deep Learning**
8. **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**
9. **Time Series Analysis**
10. **Reinforcement Learning**
