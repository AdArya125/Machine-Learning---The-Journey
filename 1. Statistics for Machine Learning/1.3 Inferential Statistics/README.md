# Introduction to Inferential Statistics

Inferential statistics is a branch of statistics that focuses on drawing conclusions about a population based on a sample of data. Unlike descriptive statistics, which only describes the collected data, inferential statistics aims to make predictions or inferences about a larger dataset.

Key concepts in inferential statistics include:

- **Population and Sample**: The population is the entire group that you want to draw conclusions about, while a sample is a subset of the population used to make inferences.
- **Sampling Methods**: Techniques used to select a sample from a population, such as random sampling, stratified sampling, and cluster sampling.
- **Estimation**: Estimating population parameters (like mean and variance) based on sample statistics.
- **Hypothesis Testing**: Procedures to test assumptions about population parameters, including null and alternative hypotheses, significance levels, and p-values.
- **Confidence Intervals**: A range of values used to estimate the true value of a population parameter, providing a measure of precision and reliability.
- **Regression Analysis**: Methods to model the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables.
